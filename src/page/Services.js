          Tanghalang Aranzazu provides programs and activities that develop
          artistic skills, spiritual growth, and community service through
          theater and formation.

        <h3>Stage & Theater Productions</h3>
        <p>
          We produce community and church-based theater performances that
          promote evangelization, Christian values, and meaningful storytelling.
          These include original plays, adapted works, and parish productions.
